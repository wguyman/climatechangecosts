##What is your true cost when you use all that carbon? 

One of the better arguments against taking serious action on climate change has been that the economic benefits of carbon (think all the flights, trips, and energy you use!) outweigh the costs of climate change. It turns out that that is no longer the case. Economically ($$) taking action through serious mitigation is better than no action, from a pure $$ ROI.
